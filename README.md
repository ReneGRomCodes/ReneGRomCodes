- So, here's the scoop: I've got a solid grip on Python basics, thanks to diving into "Think Python" by Allen B. Downey and breezing through "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. Throw in some hands-on tinkering and wrapping up courses on freeCodeCamp, and you've got me on this wild ride of expanding my coding skills! ðŸš€
  
- Besides coding Iâ€™m interested in fitness, video games and Anime.
  
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything! While I'm new to GitHub and still learning the ropes, I'm eager to jump into projects that spark my interest. Whether you stumble upon my profile and think I might have something to contribute, have an exciting project you think I'd enjoy or just want a chat don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to meet new people and ready for any mischief!

- 👋 Hi, I’m @ReneGRomCodes, or just René IRL.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, diving deep into the wonderful world of programming with books like "Think Python" by Allen B. Downey and "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, as well as courses on freeCodeCamp and whatever other resources
I can find online.
- 👀 Besides coding I’m interested in fitness, video games and Anime.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything! While I'm new to GitHub and still learning the ropes, I'm eager to jump into projects that spark my interest. Whether you stumble upon my profile and think I might have something to contribute
or you have an exciting project you think I'd enjoy, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm ready for any mischief!

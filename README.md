- So, here's the scoop: I've got a solid grip on Python, thanks to diving into "Think Python" by Allen B. Downey and breezing through "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. I've also been busy with hands-on tinkering and wrapping up courses on freeCodeCamp.

  I'm also taking on a new challenge by learning C#. Ready to keep the coding journey rolling! ðŸš€

- Besides coding Iâ€™m interested in fitness, video games and Anime.

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything! While I'm new to GitHub and still learning the ropes, I'm eager to jump into projects that spark my interest. Whether you stumble upon my profile and think I might have something to contribute, have an exciting project you think I'd enjoy or just want a chat don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to meet new people and ready for any mischief!

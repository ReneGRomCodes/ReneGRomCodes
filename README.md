Let's kick this off: I've gone deep into Python, from mastering the fundamentals with Think Python and Python Crash Course to building projects, refining my code, and exploring different aspects of programming. Along the way, Iâ€™ve also completed multiple freeCodeCamp courses and picked up plenty of hands-on experience.

  Now, I'm adding C# to the mix, taking on new challenges while sharpening my skills.

- **What I'm up to:**  
  Currently developing a dynamic character creator for Basic Fantasy RPG, with plans to turn it into a flexible mini-engine for custom RPGs. But I'm always working on something new and looking for ways to improve.
  
- **Current Project Release:**  
[**Basic Fantasy RPG Character Creator - v1.0.0**](https://github.com/ReneGRomCodes/basic_fantasy_rpg_character_creator/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

- **Beyond coding:**  
  Fitness, video games, and anime keep me busy when I'm not tinkering with code. Also, I have an unhealthy habit of digging into old games, tweaking them, and optimizing mechanics just because I can.

- **Collab? Chat? Random idea?**  
  Iâ€™m open to interesting projects, bouncing around ideas, or just having a good conversation. If something sparks your interest, hit me upâ€”Iâ€™m always happy to meet new people and ready for any mischief!
